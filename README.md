# Productive Monsters


## About

A project created for Orbital Cohort 2022 by Lim Jian Rong, Nicholas & Seah Zhi Han Mervyn.

This build was tested on a Windows 11 and Windows 10 machine.


## Motivation

As students, we often find ourselves struggling to main our focus. Adopting study and productivity methods such as the Pomodoro technique can be cumbersome, having to change our timers from 25 minutes to 5 minutes then back to 25 minutes. After hours of studying, we might also lose track of how many cycles we have completed, potentially missing a longer break.

Furthermore, students have busy schedules, having to keep track of different deadlines and assignments across their multiple modules. Additionally, some students also pursue external activities, interests and projects, contributing to their workload. 


## Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system developedd by Franceso Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique involves working for 25 minutes and resting for 5 minutes (ONE Pomodoro). Upon the completion of 4 Pomodoros, take a longer break of 15 to 20 minutes.


## Functionality

Our web application is meant to track and monitor productivity. The web application also aims to help students to closesly monitor all their modules' respective assignments and dealines.

### Pomodoro Timer

1.	As a User can set a timer according to the respective stage of the Pomodoro technique to immerse themselves in the studying technique
2.	As a User, once the timer is set, he will NOT be able to leave the application (to ensure mindfulness & productivity) to ensure the user is not distracted.
3.	As a user, once the timer is set, his notifications will be disabled as well to ensure that the user is not distracted during the stage of Pomodoro technique

### Calendar Planner

1.	As a User will be able to input their different modules, and its respective lecture and tutorial timings to keep track of their schedules
2.	As a User, will be able to key in reminders for the different deadlines of their assignments to help users keep track and meet their deadlines. (The reminders will ping them with a vibration and notification even during the respective stages of the Pomodoro Technique.)

## Interface

### Login Page

The web app is implemented with a login page that utilised Firebase by Google.

### Dashboard

The dashboard of the web app is where you will be able to see your tasks, sticky notes and the Pomodoro Timers all at one compact place.

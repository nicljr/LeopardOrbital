# Productive Monsters

## About

A project created for Orbital Cohort 2022 by Lim Jian Rong, Nicholas & Seah Zhi Han Mervyn.

This build was tested on a Windows 11 and Windows 10 machine.

## Motivation

As students, we often find ourselves struggling to main our focus. Adopting study and productivity methods such as the Pomodoro technique can be cumbersome, having to change our timers from 25 minutes to 5 minutes then back to 25 minutes. After hors of studying, we might also lose track of how many cycles we have completed, potentially missing a longer break.

Furthermore, students have busy schedules, having to keep track of different deadlines and assignments across their multiple modules. Additionally, some students also pursue external activities, interests and projects, contributing to their workload. 

## Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management system developedd by Franceso Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique involves working for 25 minutes and resting for 5 minutes (ONE Pomodoro). Upon the completion of 4 Pomodoros, take a longer break of 15 to 20 minutes.

## Functionality

Our web application is meant to track and monitor productivity. The web application also aims to help students to closesly monitor all their modules' respective assignments and dealines.

### Pomodoro Timer

1. Users will be able to set a timer according to the respective stage of the Pomodoro Technique.

### Calendar Planner

1. Users will be able to input their different modules and their respective lecture and tutorial timings.
2. Users will be able to key in reminders for the different deadlines of their assignments.
3. Users will be able to place virtual sticky notes on timings, helping them to jot down on what to prepare (questions to ask, which tutorials to complete, etc.)
4. The reminders will ping them with a vibration and notification even during the respective stages of the Pomodoro Timer.

## Interface
